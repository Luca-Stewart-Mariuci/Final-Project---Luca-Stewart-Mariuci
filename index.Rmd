## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to two possible reasearch topics:

1) Looking how many 3rd party candidates result in a spoiler effect for local elections: State House and State Senate. This would involve gathering data on general elections with three or more candidates and seeing what percentage of elections are effected by a spoiler candidate.

OR

2) Looking at the differences between property taxes of different school districts and comparing the tax received and the performances of schools in WI and/or MN. Seeing if more money means better school and at what degree is the diffrence is cuased by income of differing school districts.
